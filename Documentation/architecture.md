## Structure

In its present state, the CinemaStan only has two packages; Ui and CinemaStan default package.

The package ui contains the UI CinemaStanProgram, and the package CinemaStan contains all of the classes responsible for the application logic. This will be updated and changed very soon.

## UI

The user interface has four components:

- Opening scene/welcome scene, where the menu buttons are introduced
- Sign up scene
- Login scene
- Play game -scene

All other views are built on the initial opening scene. Most of the gameplay and sign-up/login functions (application logic) have been separated from the user interface.

## Application logic

The naming of methods will be updated in the above figure to reflect the programâ€™s current state.

## Data storage

Data storage for user data is done by implementing a database, (SQLite) and the quiz questions are added to a list. 

## Main functionalities

_TBA_

## Structural weaknesses

The program is very much a work in progress, with several internal shortcomings.

### Gameplay logic

The program doesn't ensure that a question is only asked once during a session, but randomizes through the whole list. Furthermore, the program allows the user to keep playing even though a wrong answer has been entered.

### Data storage

A text file would be more convenient for future plans of further development, when it comes to storing the questions. The integration of the SQLite database is most likely also incomplete.
